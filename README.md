## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevManSam777/portfolio_template.git
   cd portfolio_template
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   ```bash
   # Simply open index.html in your browser
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Customize**
   - Look for `TODO` comments throughout the code
   - Replace placeholder text with your actual information
   - Update `index.html` to update content
   - Modify `styles.css` for styling changes
   - Update `script.js` for functionality tweaks

## Customization

### Personal Information
Edit the following sections in `index.html`:
- **SEO Meta Tags** (in `<head>`) - Update with your name, website URL, social media handles
- **Hero section** - Your name, title, and description
- **About section** - Your bio, skills, and experience
- **Skills section** - Replace "Skill 1, 2, 3..." with your actual technologies
- **Projects section** - Replace "Project 1, 2, 3..." with your real projects
- **Contact information** - Your social media links and email

### Skills & Technologies
Update the skills grid in the HTML to match your tech stack:
```html
<div class="skill-category">
    <h3><i class="fas fa-code"></i> Frontend</h3>
    <ul class="skill-list">
        <li>Your Technology</li>
        <!-- Add more skills -->
    </ul>
</div>
```

### Colors & Styling
Customize the color scheme by modifying CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2563eb;
    --secondary-color: #1e40af;
    --accent-color: #f59e0b;
    /* Update colors to match your brand */
}
```

### Contact Form

The portfolio includes two form web components - choose the one that fits your needs:

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/DevManSam777/forms
- **Customization:** See the README in the repo for full list of customizable attributes

**Form Option 1: Short Contact Form (Default)**

The template uses the [short contact form](https://github.com/DevManSam777/forms) web component by default. This is a clean, simple contact form perfect for basic inquiries with fields for name, email, phone, and message.


**Form Option 2: Full Web Inquiry Form**

For more detailed project inquiries, you can switch to the [web-inquiry-form](https://github.com/DevManSam777/forms) component. This includes additional fields for budget, timeline, project type, and more detailed project information.


**Switching Between Forms:**

To switch between forms in `index.html`:
1. Comment out the current form's script import in the `<head>` section
2. Uncomment the desired form's script import
3. Comment out the current form component in the Contact section
4. Uncomment the desired form component

Both forms are highly customizable through HTML attributes including colors (light/dark mode), typography, border radius, and custom messages.

**Backend Options:**

Both forms require a backend API endpoint:

**Option 1: Use DevLeads (Recommended)**

[DevLeads](https://github.com/devmansam777/devleads) is a complete lead/project management system that:
- Sends email notifications to you and your clients
- Tracks and manages leads/projects
- Provides a dashboard to view all inquiries
- Includes a built-in API endpoint for both forms

Simply deploy DevLeads and update the form's `endpoint` or `api-url` attribute to point to your DevLeads instance.

**Option 2: Use Your Own API**

Create your own backend API endpoint and update the `endpoint` (for minimalist-contact-form) or `api-url` (for web-inquiry-form) attribute in the form component.

**Option 3: Replace the Form**

Replace the form component with your preferred form solution.

### Optional Features

**Blog Integration:**
The template includes commented-out code for fetching blog posts from Hashnode's GraphQL API.

To enable:
1. Uncomment the blog section in `index.html`
2. Uncomment the blog functions in `script.js`
3. Update the Hashnode blog URL in the `fetchHashnodePosts()` function
4. Uncomment the blog nav link

**Optional Web Components:**
Uncomment these in `index.html` if you want to use them:
- **Typewriter Effect** - Animated typing text
- **Custom Cursor** - Custom mouse cursor design
- **Back-to-Top Button** - Smooth scroll to top

All web components are by [DevManSam777](https://github.com/DevManSam777).
